## DATA STRUCTURES, MODERN OPERATORS AND STRINGS

###Destructuring Arrays###

This is an ES6 feature and its a way of unpacking values from an array or an object into separate variables i.e. Unpacking a complex data structure into a smaller data structure like a variable.


***The Spread Operator***

The spread operator can be used to expand an array into all its element. unpacking all array elements at once.

For instance; *without The Spread Operator*; This is how we can add numbers at the beginning of this array (arr).




```javascript
const arr = [3, 4, 5];
const badNewArr = [1, 2, arr[0] , arr[1], arr[2]];
console.log badNewArr;

```
